# :book: About this Project

This project is a developer test for the company [Buzzvel](https://buzzvel.com/). It consists of converting the Figma designs provided into fully functional web/mobile pages using React. It's the website of Soller, a company that offers complete solar energy solutions for homes.

The requirements include ensure the design is fully responsive and looks good on all screen sizes, animations to enhance the user experience, SEO optimization and a high performance result.

I used approaches like: lazy loading images, SEO optimization with react helmet and mobile first.
